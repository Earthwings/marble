/**
 * @short a painter that makes it easy to draw geometric items on the map
 *
 * This class enables application developers to paint simple geometric
 * shapes and objects on the map. The API is inspired by and
 * compatible to QPainter.
 *
 * All methods are using Geographic coordinates to position the item.
 * However while being placed in geographic coordinates the
 * shape of the objects could still use the screen coordinates
 * ( isGeoProjected = false ).
 * Alternatively the shape of the object can get projected according
 * to Marble's current projection (e.g. spherical projection)
 * ( isGeoProjected = true ).
 * If screen coordinates get used then e.g. width and height
 * are assumed to be expressed in pixels, otherwise degrees are
 * used.
 *
 * Painter transformations (e.g. translate) always happen in screen
 * coordinates.
 *
 * NOTE: Like in QPainter drawing objects should always be a
 * VOLATILE operation! This means that e.g. placemarks don't get
 * added to the globe permanently. So unless you do the drawing on
 * every repaint the objects you draw will disappear on the next
 * paint event.
 *
 * So if you want to add placemarks to your map PERMANENTLY
 * (i.e. you don't need to take care of repainting) then
 * please use other means such as the KML import.
 *
 * See docs/paintingmaps.txt for more information.
