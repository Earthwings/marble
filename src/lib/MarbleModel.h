/**
 * @short The data model (not based on QAbstractModel) for a MarbleWidget.
 *
 * This class provides a data storage and indexer that can be
 * displayed in a MarbleWidget.  It contains 3 different datatypes:
 * <b>tiles</b> which provide the background, <b>vectors</b> which
 * provide things like country borders and coastlines and
 * <b>placemarks</b> which can show points of interest, such as
 * cities, mountain tops or the poles.
 *
 * The <b>tiles</b> provide the background of the image and can be for
 * instance height and depth fields, magnetic strength, topographic
 * data or anything else that is area based.
 *
 * The <b>vectors</b> provide things like country borders and
 * coastlines.  They are stored in separate files and can be added or
 * removed at anytime.
 *
 * The <b>placemarks</b> contain points of interest, such as cities,
 * mountain tops or the poles. These are sorted by size (for cities)
 * and category (capitals, other important cities, less important
 * cities, etc) and are displayed with different color or shape like
 * square or round.
